#rust_ec2

###Notes
This is a high level ec2 interface written in rust built on top of [rusoto](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto) and is my first project written in rust.

I'm not quite finished and for now examples for how to use are found in src/main.rs.txt

If you have any tips or suggestions please raise an issue!

###Acknowledgements
I could not have even remotely attempted this project if it wasn't for the work of [Jon Gjengset](https://github.com/jonhoo) who showed up literally everywhere as the single resource with helpful examples on the rusoto issues page, youtube, and in his own Github repositories
